# map-project

To run this program, open index.html in any web browser.

The goal of this project was to utilize different APIs to create a map of a neighborhood that I love. I chose Riverside in Jacksonville, Florida.

The APIs that are in use in this project are the Google Maps API, Google Places API, and the Foursqaure API.

You can either click on a marker to see more information about that business, browse the list on the side and click there, or search for a place yourself. The search
bar that was implemented is part of the Google Maps API and it searches the Maps API database for whatever you type in.
